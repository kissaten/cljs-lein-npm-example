# cljsnode

Clojurescript based reference SPA on Heroku using node express, bootstrap,
reactjs/reagent and Kioo templates, demonstrating "isomorphic" clojurescript
shared between frontend and backend and Figwheel hotloading code changes
to both.

Check it out at https://cljsnode.herokuapp.com

Fork on github as a starting point for your own projects.
A goal is to turn this into a Leiningen template.
